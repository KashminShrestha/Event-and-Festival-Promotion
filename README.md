## Feature 


[1]: Organizer and Event Approval Workflow
Overview
Feature 1 in your codebase is the robust approval workflow for both Organizers and Events. This workflow ensures that only verified organizers and approved events are available on the platform, adding a layer of trust and quality control.

Key Capabilities
1. Organizer Approval & Rejection
Admin-only Actions: Only admin users can approve or reject organizers.

Status Tracking: Organizers have a status field (pending, approved, rejected) and a verified_by field to track the admin who performed the action.

Audit Logging: Every approval or rejection is logged in the AuditLog for transparency.

Example Endpoints:

POST /api/organizers/{id}/approve/ â€” Approves an organizer.

POST /api/organizers/{id}/reject/ â€” Rejects an organizer.

2. Event Approval, Rejection, and Status Change
Admin-only Actions: Only admins can approve, reject, or change the status of events.

Status Field: Events have a status (draft, published, cancelled).

Audit Logging: Every change is recorded in the AuditLog.

Example Endpoints:

POST /api/events/{id}/approve/ â€” Publishes the event.

POST /api/events/{id}/reject/ â€” Cancels the event.

POST /api/events/{id}/change_status/ â€” Changes event status (e.g., from draft to published).

3. Permissions and Ownership
Organizer Permissions: Only approved organizers can create or manage their own events.

Event Ownership: Only the event owner (organizer) can update or delete their event, and only when the event is in draft or cancelled state.

4. Multilingual Support
Language Switching: Event names and descriptions can be returned in Nepali or English, depending on the Accept-Language header.

Example API Usage
Approve an Organizer
text
POST /api/organizers/5/approve/
Authorization: Token <admin-token>
Response:

json
{
  "detail": "Organizer approved successfully."
}
Approve an Event
text
POST /api/events/10/approve/
Authorization: Token <admin-token>
Response:

json
{
  "detail": "Event approved and published."
}
Benefits
Quality Control: Ensures only vetted organizers and events are visible to users.

Accountability: Audit logs provide a trail of all admin actions.

Security: Strict permission checks prevent unauthorized actions.

Localization: Multilingual support enhances accessibility for diverse users.
